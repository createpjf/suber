# Privacy Policy — Suber

**Last updated:** February 7, 2026

## Overview

Suber is a Chrome extension for tracking and managing personal subscriptions. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data Suber collects, how it is used, and your rights.

## Data Collection

**Suber does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data.**

All subscription data (names, amounts, billing cycles, categories, and settings) is stored locally on your device using Chrome's built-in `chrome.storage.local` API. No data ever leaves your browser.

## Data Storage

- All data is stored **locally** in your browser's extension storage.
- No data is sent to any external server, cloud service, or third party.
- No analytics, tracking, or telemetry is collected.
- No cookies are used.

## Permissions

Suber requests the following browser permissions:

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `storage` | Save your subscription data and settings locally in the browser |
| `alarms` | Schedule daily checks for upcoming billing dates |
| `notifications` | Send you reminders before subscription renewals |

These permissions are used solely to provide the core functionality of the extension. No data accessed through these permissions is transmitted externally.

## Third-Party Services

Suber does not integrate with or send data to any third-party services. Website favicon images are loaded directly from public favicon endpoints for display purposes only.

## Data Export and Deletion

- You can **export** all your data as a JSON file at any time via Settings.
- You can **delete** all your data at any time via Settings > Clear All Data.
- Uninstalling the extension removes all stored data.

## Children's Privacy

Suber does not knowingly collect any data from children under 13.
